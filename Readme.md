# PLL 
 A phase-locked loop or PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. \
 PLLs are widely used for synchronization purposes, including clock generation and distribution inside the SoCâ€™s.
 We will be building the PLL using 28nm technology node.
